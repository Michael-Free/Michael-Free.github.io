<p>The legacy system caused frequent outages, frozen players, disruptive OS notifications, and required on-site manual intervention—often involving ladder access to power-cycle devices. Windows updates, advertisements, and OS instability made reliable video playback impossible at scale.</p>
<p>To solve this, I built a custom minimal Debian-based distribution, designed specifically for digital signage reliability. The operating system installation was fully automated using Debian preseed, producing a custom ISO with no interactive setup. A dedicated systemd service ensured the latest campaign video played continuously and reliably on boot.</p>
<p>A suite of Ansible playbooks provided centralized control of all signage players across multiple remote branches, enabling:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remote start/stop of signage playback</li>
<li>Scheduled nightly content updates from a central file server</li>
<li>Remote software updates and controlled reboots</li>
<li>Fleet-wide management with no physical access required</li>
</ul>
<p>For resiliency, a Cockpit web UI was deployed on each player, allowing manual recovery and control if Ansible connectivity was unavailable.</p>
<p><strong>Key highlights:</strong></p>

<h3 id="ubuntu-os-upgrade-with-ansible">Ubuntu OS Upgrade with Ansible</h3>
<p>Automated the upgrade of a corporate website VM from Ubuntu 22.04 to 24.04, eliminating a previously manual, multi-hour process that risked significant downtime.</p>
<p>Using Ansible playbooks and a staged local VM environment, I implemented a zero-touch upgrade process that reduced website downtime from hours to just a few minutes. The solution was fully repeatable and required minimal manual intervention, allowing operations to run smoothly without disrupting users.</p>
<p><strong>Key highlights:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Zero-touch OS upgrades for minimal downtime</li>
<li>Staged testing environment to validate upgrades before production</li>
<li>Automated, repeatable playbooks for consistent results</li>
<li>Business continuity maintained with near-invisible service impact</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Impact:</strong> Transformed a time-consuming, risky maintenance task into a fast, reliable, automated operation, impressing stakeholders and improving operational confidence in future upgrades.</p></div>
