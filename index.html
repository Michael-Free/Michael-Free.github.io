                <hr class="w3-clear">
                <p>In my experience, I have demonstrated a strong ability to handle a wide range of tasks and responsibilities within the field of IT.  My  repositories on GitHub show a diverse set of technical skills, including the ability to automate various task from installation and configuration, to data analysis and innovation.</p>
                <p>Aside from my specific skills, I have demonstrated a strong ability to work effectively within a team. I've also demonstrated a passion for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of department and teams in day-to-day operations to reduce manual processing and tasks to a minimum.</p>
                <p>My professional experience has given me the opportunity to work with a wide range of vendors, resellers, and distributors to procure software and hardware assets for organizations.  It's also given me the expertise of engaging these parties for technical support when the need arises.  This experience has given me a deep understanding of the various products, services, and practices that are available and implemented on the market.  It has given me a keen sense of appropriate decisions about what products and services to choose that fit organizational needs.</p>
                <p>This page was created because I am not a huge fan of social media. I lack a presence in any of the major platforms (LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, etc) and decided to create something that I control and respects the creator (and visitor) of this page.</p>

                        <p>- Performed day-to-day operations such as basic PC troubleshooting for staff - to more in-depth problems that arise from a larger organization.</p>
                        <p>- Compiled written reports and proposals for management and other stakeholders on projects, capital expenditures, and operating expenditures.</p>
                        <p>- Worked with Vendors, Resellers, and Distributors to procure software and hardware assets for the organization. This also includes engaging vendors for technical support.</p>
                        <p>- Created an auto-install of Windows 10 that took installs (and re-installs) from days per-machine down to a few minutes per-machine with pre-installed software.</p>
                        <p>- Created a Post-Install/Configuration script using Python that performed critical configurations of staff and Public-Use PCs that further reduced configuration time. This freed up time for the rest of the IT Services Team to perform daily operations.</p>
                        <p>- Compiled usage reports on Public and Staff Wifi Usage Statistics. Report processing was reduced from a manual process taking 20 minutes per-day of logs on an Excel sheet down to a process that filled several days of logs per-minute.  This further freed up time for the rest of the IT Services Team to perform their daily operations.</p>
                        <p>- Implemented OpenVAS to discover, patch, and mitigate critical vulnerabilities that existed within the public and staff networks.</p>
                        <p>- Migrated the organization away from troublesome Digital Signage management solutions with older Commercial Displays to using Consumer-Grade TVs that are automated with Home Assistant, further reducing support calls and reducing our power usage using scheduling.</p>
                        <p>- Worked with the local Amateur Radio Club to LiveStream a HAM Radio Call with the International Space Station and Astronauts with local children.

                        <p>- Performed a comprehensive IT Asset Inventory.  Created a Powershell Script that polled the Domain Controller for PCs. This script pulled make, model, serial number, hardware specs, peripherals, and other information about systems. </p>
                        <p>- Helped deploy a new website in Azure Cloud Platform using LXD containers. Developed a BASH script to automate the install of Drupal and its various requirements.</p>
                        <p>- Developed a Python/Powershell framework that can automatically move a machine from and old domain to a new one, without having to physically visiting each computer.</p>
                        <p>- Assisted in the re-build of a new Windows Domain Controller.  Created various Group Policies to manage users and PCs throughout the organization.</p>
                        <p>- Deployed, maintained, and managed Windows and Linux virtual machines using VMWare vSphere.</p>
                        <p>- Introduced Yubikeys to the IT Services Team as a means of secure login.</p>

                        <p>- Moved the organization away from password protected Excel sheets with login credentials to a more secure password management and authentication system. This increased our security posture, while also decreasing the burden of credential management and credential sharing.</p>
                        <p>- Migrated the IT Services Team from Spiceworks to JIRA Service Management with no downtime or missing tickets.</p>
                        <p>- Migrated the entire Facilities Team from Spiceworks using a self-created Python application that parsed almost a decade of historical tickets that were imported from a complicated JSON file to JIRA Service Management. There was no downtime, or critical issues encountered by the Facilities Team.</p>
                        <p>- Helped train and on-board Facilities Team members on the new ticketing system.</p>
                        <p>- Steered the team towards using Chocolatey Package Manager to automate, improve, and streamline software upgrades on the Windows 10 Desktops.</p>
